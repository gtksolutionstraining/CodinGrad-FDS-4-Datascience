You have an image with 1000*1000 

there are m number of examples: 
    each example is an image with 1000*1000

n_x = (1000000)

Neural Network --> 
    1st layer --> (1M nodes)

W1 = (1000000,1M)
b1 = (1M,1)
            ===> 1000B
            ===> 1parameter takes 32bit 
            ===> 1000B*4
            ===> 1Million TB

Convolutional Neural Networks --> CNN

The building block of the CNNs is Convolution operation

NVIDIA GPUs

CUDA


Transformers ==> ChatGPT, Bard
