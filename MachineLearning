1. Supervised ML:
--> Involvs Training to build an ML Model.
--> ML model --> Is a mathematical function
--> Training Data
--> House Price Prediction
    1. House Size --x1
    2. House Occupancy --x2
    3. # Bathrooms --x3
    4. Age of House
    5. KMs distant from a school
    6. KMs distant from a hospital
    7. KMs distant from Public Travel Place
    8. KMs distant from Working Place
    9. Water Service
    10. Locality

--> Above 10 are called features to predict the house price.
--> Label/Target Variable/Output Variable --> House Price


Terminology:
    1. Training Set --> Historic Data
    2. x -- input variable/input feature/House Size
    3. y -- output variable/output feature/label
    4. m no of examples/observations
        1. x1 --> y1
        2. x2 --> y2
        3. x3 --> y3
        ......
        m. xm --> ym
    5. (x(i),y(i)) --> ith example --> x(i) ith input variable(ith house size) and y(i) is the respective house price

    Training Data --> Learning Algorithm --> x --> f --> y_pred


       loss = absolute(y_pred - y_actual)

       y_pred = f(x)


        xx --> Predict what can be the price for this
y = mx + c

c --> intercept --> when x = 0 for what value the line is intercepting at y is called intercept

m --> direction + slope
    1. sign of the m is -ve --> direction is downwards
    2. sign of the m is +ve --> direction is upwards
    3. value of the m will tell how much leaned the function is w.r.t y

differntiations & partial differentiation & Limits

f(x) = y_pred = Wx + b

    1. W --> Weights
    2. b --> bias

Ways of finding best W, b for the function.
1. Bruteforce
    1. Give random values for W, b
    2. Mean Absolute Error = (Sigma(0,m) abs(y_actual(i)-y_pred(i)))/m 
        error = 0
        for i in range(0,m):
            error += abs(Y_actual[i]-Y_pred[i])
        meanabsoluteError = error/m
   *3. Mean Squarred Error = (Sigma(0,m) square(y_actual(i)-y_pred(i)))/m
        error = 0
        for i in rang(0,m):
            error += (y_actual[i]-y_pred[i])**2
        meansquaredError = error/m

    J(W,b)/loss/cost_function = 1/2m * Sigma(0,m) (Y_actual[i]-Y_pred[i])^2
    --> If you find the exact function or ideal function --> the error rate is 0


1. You should be convinced function is ML model
2. You should be convinced on y = mx + c ==> Linear Line
3. what is x, what is y
4. Historic Data --> We already have x,y
5. We need find a pattern of y w.r.t x ==> Its NP Problem
6. y = mx+c --> Proper m,c --> You need find this
7. Brute force --> m,c/ W,b
    1. How much the random ML model is wrong/right w.r.t actual data --> What is the cost/loss
        1. Mean Absolute Error
        2. Mean Squarred Error

    MSE ~= 0
    MSE == 0

    2. J(W,b) = 1/2m * Sigma(0,m) (y_pred[i]-y_actual[i])**2

J(w,b) = 1/2m * Sigma(0,m) (Wx[i] + b - y_actual[i]) ** 2

J(W,b) --> Convex Function

EVery Convex Function is differentiable and we can get global minima.



differentiation:
y = f(x)
    1. How much and how the Y is affected by a small change in x.
    2. Lt (h->0) (f(x+h)-f(x))/h
    3. The befaviours/characterestics of the function at x.
    4. differentiation is slope of the function
    5. The differentiation will guide you to go the global minima.

partial differentiation:
y = f(x1,x2,x3,x4,...xn)
    1. When we have more than one variable as dependent variables.
    2. Partial differentiation of y w.r.t x1 will tell u how much y is affecting by small change in x1
    3. Partial differentiation of y w.r.t x1 will guide you in what direction you need go for x1 you will get global minima.
