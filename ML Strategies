Model Deployment/Inference:
    Realtime Inference:

    C++ to deploy the model.

    Model:
        1. Quantization --> 
        2. XLA --> Accelerated Linear Algebra.
            1. NVIDIA's CUDA
            2. AMD's RoCm
            3. FPGA's Architecture
            4. Google TPUs

Train/Validation(Dev)(hold_out)(cross validation)/Test

100%

Split Criteria: (Random Split)
    1. Train ===> 80%
    2. Validation ===> 15%
    3. Test      ====> 5%


We have to use Train and Validation splits for Training the model

We will test the model using Test Dataset.

Data Distribution:
    1. we should mantain similar distribution for Validation and Test

Split Criteria:
    1. Domain Knowledge
    2. Context Problem
    3. Overall Data Distribution
    4. Prepare validation and test set in such a way that the distribution of them should be most likely similar.


Train/Validation/Test:

Model Training:

    1. We have Training Dataset
    2. We will forward propagate with Trainining Dataset
        1. Find the loss
    3. We will find the loss of Validation Dataset
    4. Backward Propagation
    5. Repeat 2-4 until converge.

Every Iteration:
    1. Trainining Loss    - 1%        15%        15%
    2. Validation Loss    - 11%       16%        30%
                        - Variance  High Bias      Variance & Bias

Bias: Error/Loss between the average model predictions and the groundtruth.

Variance: Average variability in the model prediction for the given validation dataset.

High Bias:
    --> Underfitting
    --> Overly Simplified Model
    --> High bias/error in Training dataset and Validation Dataset 

High Variance:
    --> Overfitting
    --> Overly Complexed Model
    --> Low error on Training dataset and High error in Validation dataset

Bias & Tradeoff.

Solutions for Solving Bias:
    1. Bigger Neural Network/CNN
    2. Increasing the Training dataset
    3. Train for Long time.
    4. Come up with New Neural Network Architecture.

Solutions for Solving Variance:
    1. More Data in Training and Validation
    2. Regularization
    3. Come up with New Neural Network Architecture.


Regularization:
    1. Low Training Loss and High Validation Loss
    2. Training is good but failing in exam.
    3. Add some penalty to Training Loss

J(W,b) = 1/m * Sigma(0,1)(Y_pred(i)-Y_actual(i))**2 + penalty

        ==> Norma ==> A and B --> (A.B) 
        ==> L2 Norm       ==> (x1,x2,x3,..) (y1,y2,y3,...) --> (x1-y1)**2 +
    ==> L1-Regularization
    ==> L2-Regularization

penalty = (lambda/(2*m)) * (L2-Norm(W) + b**2)

Dropout: It is a ml strategy which will also solve Variance Problem.

    Dropping out neurons in the layer randomly while training only

    1. Model Training
    2. Training Dataset
    3. Iteration 
        for layer in layers:
            random_neurons = random
            turnoff those neurons
        backward propagation
    4. 3 step should be repeated

Normalization:

    Featureset X --> mean
    Normalized X = X-Mean(X)/standard deviation(X)

Vanishing & Exploding Gradients:
    1. You have initialized low numbers as weights
    2. Network is very very big
    3. Then there can be a problem called Vanishing Gradients/Weights

    4. You have initialized high numbers as weights
    5. You large loss
    6. there can be problem called Exploding Graidents/Weights

Weight Initializing:
    1. Random Weight Initialization
    2. Random Weight Initialization * Initializing Multiplier

    Initializing Multiplier 
        1. Tanh --> sqrt(1/n[L-1])
        2. relu --> sqrt(2/n[L-1])
        3. Leaky relu
        ==> sqrt(2/(n[l-1]+n[l]))
