Model Deployment/Inference:
    Realtime Inference:

    C++ to deploy the model.

    Model:
        1. Quantization --> 
        2. XLA --> Accelerated Linear Algebra.
            1. NVIDIA's CUDA
            2. AMD's RoCm
            3. FPGA's Architecture
            4. Google TPUs
        3. Model Convertion
            1. ONNX

Train/Validation(Dev)(hold_out)(cross validation)/Test

100%

Split Criteria: (Random Split)
    1. Train ===> 80%
    2. Validation ===> 15%
    3. Test      ====> 5%


We have to use Train and Validation splits for Training the model

We will test the model using Test Dataset.

Data Distribution:
    1. we should mantain similar distribution for Validation and Test

Split Criteria:
    1. Domain Knowledge
    2. Context Problem
    3. Overall Data Distribution
    4. Prepare validation and test set in such a way that the distribution of them should be most likely similar.
