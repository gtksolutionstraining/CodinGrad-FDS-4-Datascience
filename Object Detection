Object Detection: Classifying and locating an object in an image.

1.Sliding Window
2.Region based algorithms
    1. RCNN
    2. Fast RCNN
    3. Faster RCNN
    4. Mask RCNN
    5. YOLO
        1. v1--v8

YOLO: You Only Look Once.

Input is an image. (32,32,3)
YOLO Grid ==> (3,3)


Output ==> (3,3,8)

Applications:
    1. Security Surviliance
    2. Manufacturing Industries
    3. Brain Tumor Detection


Metric --> Intersection over Union

Non Max Supression. --> Will supress the boxes that are predicted by the model and their Intersection over Union is less.

Anchor Boxes: --> if the object's center points lies in the same gridcell then the number of objects should be in the label.

    The number of objects is called Anchor Boxes.


YOLO Alorithm: --> (19,19)
    1. Anchor Box = 1
    2. Grid Size = (3,3) 
    3. Output Labels = P,bx,by,bw,bh,C1,C2,C3
    4. input image size = (32,32,3)

Step1: Feed the Image to model
Step2: Model will give an output (3,3,8)
Step3: Model predicted 9 boxes
Step4: Non Max Supression Algorithm 
    Step1: For each box if P<0.5 --> Supress all the box
    Step2: Find IoU for each box and get the maximum box
    Step3: Supress all non max boxes
    Step4: Output only one box which has maximum IoU
Step5: With given a box by NonMax Algorithm --> We Use OpenCV and draw a contour around the object.
