Input image (n,n)
filter matrix (f,f) --> Kernel f belongs to 1,3,5,7,9,..

        n = 6
        f = 3

output matrix shape of convolution operation of input matrix and filter is
        n - f + 1

        (4,4)

convolution operation will understand the image
    an edge detector
    extract important features in an image.


Padded convolution:
    input image == (6,6)
    filter = (3,3)
    p = 1

    output_matrix = n+2p-f+1
                  = 6+2-3+1
                  = 6

When you are building an ML model to predict something. That something is around corners of the image.
